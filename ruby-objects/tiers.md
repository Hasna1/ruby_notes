* To a computer, it's all ones and zeros
* Abstractions make your code make sense to *humans*

# Tiers of Abstraction

* Variables
  * give a name to a chunk of data

* Functions
  * give a name to a chunk of code
  * encapsulate input, output, and local variables

* Closures
  * function plus scope of defining function
  * allow several chunks of code to share state

* Structs
  * put several pieces of related data together

* Objects
  * encapsulate data *and* behavior
  * allow several chunks of code to share extra state

* Classes
  * reuse code and data for different instances
