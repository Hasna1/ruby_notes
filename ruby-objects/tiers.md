* To a computer, it's all ones and zeros
* Abstractions make your code make sense to *humans*

# Tiers of Abstraction

* Variables
  * give your data a name
* Functions
  * input, output, local variables
* Closures
  * functions plus scope
* Objects
  * encapsulation
  * gives several functions a common state
* Classes
  * a class is a category
  * so you don't have to keep adding the same methods onto similar objects
