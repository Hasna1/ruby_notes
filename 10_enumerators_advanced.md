This topic is too advanced for a two-day Ruby class.

Ref. WGR Chapter 10

# Enumerable

* `Enumerable` is a module you can mix in to your own classes
* you also have to define an `each` method

# Enumerable Methods

    Enumerable.instance_methods(false).sort

# Enumerators

* similar to iterators
* iterator is a *method*
* enumerator is an *object*
