* Blocks and Iterators

# The Ruby Object Model

# Test-First Teaching

* We use tests to check for code correctness
* We use tests to define the task to implement
* We know we're done when the tests pass

Conceived by Sarah Allen and Alex Chaffee

# Let's get started

Install Ruby, e.g.

    http://installfest.railsbridge.org

then open a terminal window and type this:

    git clone https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby.git

    cd learn_ruby

then open `index.html` in a browser

# Very Important Tips!

## Arrange Your Windows

  * Make your console window REALLY TALL

## READ THE ERROR

  * This is actually **very difficult** to do consistently and accurately
  * When you get an error, **SCROLL UP** and read down STARTING from where YOU HIT RETURN
